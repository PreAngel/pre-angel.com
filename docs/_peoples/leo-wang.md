Leo Wang, with over two decades of experience in China's mobile internet sector, began his journey at Huawei and quickly ascended as a prominent figure in the tech investment landscape. As a cornerstone of the PreAngel Fund since its inception in 2011, Leo embodies the fund's philosophy: "Companion and help, not hinder." With a portfolio that boasts more than 300 tech startups, he has shown a remarkable ability to identify and nurture promising ventures, especially in frontier technology, mobile internet, Blockchain, and AI.

Together with his dedicated team at PreAngel, Leo manages a $50 million investment fund, zeroing in on next-generation technologies like AI and Blockchain.
